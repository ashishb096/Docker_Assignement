To implement this project, let's break it down into several steps:

1. Frontend with Node.js (Express):

      You'll create a form using HTML in the frontend, and use Express to serve the form and send a request to the Flask backend.

2. Backend with Flask:

      Flask will handle the form submission, process the data, and respond to the frontend.

3. Folder Structure:

      Organize the project with two folders: frontend (for the Express app) and backend (for the Flask app).

4. Docker Configuration:

  You'll create Dockerfiles for both the frontend and backend and configure Docker Compose to run them together.
